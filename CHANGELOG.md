# Changelog

## v0.1.1 — 2026-07-05

Field-driven patch release: fixes and one small feature from the first real
pairing sessions after v0.1.0. No breaking changes.

### Added
- **Reply composers can ask a follow-up question** — a Comment/Ask toggle on
  the rail and line-comment reply boxes; a question-reply re-flags the thread
  as awaiting the agent. The unanswered-question signal now counts a human
  question asked anywhere in a thread (not only at its root).

### Fixed
- **Marketplace/plugin installs now ship the enforcement hooks** — the
  PreToolUse rejected-approach gate + the Stop review checkpoint travel with
  the plugin (`hooks/hooks.json`), so "stopped before the edit lands" holds on
  the marketplace path, not just `deeppairing init`. The hook only ever asks
  (never hard-blocks) and fails open on every error.
- **The companion UI URL is pushed, never guessed** — the live daemon port is
  surfaced in the first-call preamble and every `check_feedback` response, so
  the agent stops hallucinating `localhost:5173`.
- **The daemon releases its listen socket promptly on shutdown** —
  SIGTERM/idle/evict now close the HTTP server before the flush, freeing the
  port for the next daemon (fewer EADDRINUSE stalls on restart/doctor).
- **Tests can no longer write the developer's real `~/.deeppairing` ledger** —
  a global-store guard isolates every test; a stray unit test had polluted the
  cross-project ledger with 222 phantom "Railway" rejections.

### Docs / internal
- README front-door already shipped in v0.1.0; refreshed the screenshots to the
  current Ledger UI, and the capture flow now runs in CI as a
  selector-integrity check so it can't rot silently.
- Web-dom contention test-timeout tuning; e2e daemons isolated to a temp HOME.


## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-04

First public release. deepPairing is an MCP server + companion web UI that
turns Claude Code into a pairing partner: structured artifacts for findings,
options, plans, and code changes; a cross-project Philosophy Ledger that
remembers your rejections and blocks re-proposals before the edit lands.

### Highlights
- **12 MCP tools + a 13th (`update_plan_progress`)** — non-blocking present/check_feedback loop; the agent presents, you review in the UI, it picks up your verdicts.
- **Decision cards** — options with pros/cons/effort/risk, concept naming, optional prediction + confidence capture on high-stakes calls, and ✓/✗/◐ retrospectives that build a calibration record.
- **The Ledger** — cross-project taste (`~/.deeppairing/philosophy/v1.json`), a PreToolUse gate that stops rejected concepts pre-edit, weekly digest, and a compounding badge.
- **Live plan checklists** — step-by-step progress streamed over WebSocket while the agent executes.
- **Session replay** — command palette → "Browse past sessions (replay)"; scrubber, annotations, and a read-only store guard so history can't be mutated.
- **Multi-project** — deterministic per-project daemon ports (3847–3974, hash-derived), a project switcher with pending counts, and cross-session owner routing so verdicts land in the right session's store.
- **Keyboard-first review** — j/k/n navigation, armed-countdown approvals (never one-keystroke commits), q to ask, Escape everywhere it should work.
- **Accessibility** — axe gate in CI with zero disabled rules, both themes AA, focus management on teardown paths, a real `<main>` landmark.
- **Distribution** — self-contained committed plugin bundle (marketplace or `--plugin-dir`, no build), `deeppairing` CLI (`init` / `doctor --fix` / `demo` / `export`), VS Code webview extension.

### Engineering posture
- 1,636 tests (1,518 server+web / 118 shared) + Playwright e2e incl. a live axe net
- TypeScript strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` across all packages; `rules-of-hooks` as a lint error
- ESLint warning ratchets (lower-never-raise); CI staleness gate keeps the committed plugin bundle honest
