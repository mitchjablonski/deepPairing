# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-04

First public release. deepPairing is an MCP server + companion web UI that
turns Claude Code into a pairing partner: structured artifacts for findings,
options, plans, and code changes; a cross-project Philosophy Ledger that
remembers your rejections and blocks re-proposals before the edit lands.

### Highlights
- **12 MCP tools + a 13th (`update_plan_progress`)** — non-blocking present/check_feedback loop; the agent presents, you review in the UI, it picks up your verdicts.
- **Decision cards** — options with pros/cons/effort/risk, concept naming, optional prediction + confidence capture on high-stakes calls, and ✓/✗/◐ retrospectives that build a calibration record.
- **The Ledger** — cross-project taste (`~/.deeppairing/philosophy/v1.json`), a PreToolUse gate that stops rejected concepts pre-edit, weekly digest, and a compounding badge.
- **Live plan checklists** — step-by-step progress streamed over WebSocket while the agent executes.
- **Session replay** — command palette → "Browse past sessions (replay)"; scrubber, annotations, and a read-only store guard so history can't be mutated.
- **Multi-project** — deterministic per-project daemon ports (3847–3974, hash-derived), a project switcher with pending counts, and cross-session owner routing so verdicts land in the right session's store.
- **Keyboard-first review** — j/k/n navigation, armed-countdown approvals (never one-keystroke commits), q to ask, Escape everywhere it should work.
- **Accessibility** — axe gate in CI with zero disabled rules, both themes AA, focus management on teardown paths, a real `<main>` landmark.
- **Distribution** — self-contained committed plugin bundle (marketplace or `--plugin-dir`, no build), `deeppairing` CLI (`init` / `doctor --fix` / `demo` / `export`), VS Code webview extension.

### Engineering posture
- 1,636 tests (1,518 server+web / 118 shared) + Playwright e2e incl. a live axe net
- TypeScript strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` across all packages; `rules-of-hooks` as a lint error
- ESLint warning ratchets (lower-never-raise); CI staleness gate keeps the committed plugin bundle honest
